## Sequential Logic

This folder contains basic sequential logic designs that operate on clock edges
and maintain state.

### Modules
- `dff.v` – D Flip-Flop with synchronous reset

### Concepts Covered
- Edge-triggered logic
- Non-blocking assignments
- Reset behavior
- State storage elements

### Skills Demonstrated
- Correct use of clocked always blocks
- Safe reset handling
- RTL modeling of storage elements
