## FSM Basics

This folder contains basic Finite State Machine (FSM) implementations,
including Moore and Mealy machines.

### Modules
- `fsm.v` – Basic FSM implementation
- `m_fsm.v` – Mealy FSM example
- `mo_fsm.v` – Moore FSM example

### Concepts Covered
- FSM state encoding
- Next-state logic
- Moore vs Mealy FSM differences
- Separation of combinational and sequential logic

### Skills Demonstrated
- Structured FSM coding style
- Clean state transitions
- Output logic based on state and input
