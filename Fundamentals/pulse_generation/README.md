## Pulse Generation

This folder contains designs focused on generating clean, single-cycle pulses
from input signals.

### Modules
- `one_hot_pulse_1001.v` – FSM-based pulse generation
- `debounce_pulse.v` – Debounced pulse generation from a mechanical input

### Concepts Covered
- One-shot pulse generation
- Edge detection using FSMs
- Combining debounce and pulse logic

### Skills Demonstrated
- Control signal generation
- FSM-based pulse shaping
- Reliable event signaling in synchronous systems
