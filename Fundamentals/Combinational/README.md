## Combinational Logic

This folder contains basic combinational logic designs implemented using Verilog.
These modules do not depend on clock signals and purely represent combinational behavior.

### Modules
- `logic_gates.v` – Gate-level modeling using primitive gates
- `gate_always.v` – Combinational logic using `always @(*)` and `case` statements

### Concepts Covered
- Gate-level vs behavioral modeling
- Blocking assignments
- Case-based logic selection
- Combinational sensitivity lists

### Skills Demonstrated
- Writing synthesizable combinational logic
- Understanding logic inference in RTL
