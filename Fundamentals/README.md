# Verilog Fundamentals

This section contains my foundational Verilog HDL work, organized by design categories.
The focus is on building strong RTL fundamentals with clear module structure and
independent testbenches for each design.

The codes here were written as part of my self-learning journey in Digital Design,
with emphasis on understanding how hardware behaves at the RTL level rather than
just producing outputs.

## Structure
- Combinational logic designs
- Sequential logic designs
- Counters and timer-based circuits
- FSM basics (Moore & Mealy)
- Real-world FSM-based designs
- Pulse generation and control circuits

Each sub-folder contains:
- `source_codes/` – RTL design files
- `testbenches/` – Independent testbenches
- `images/` (where applicable) – Simulation waveforms

## Skills Demonstrated
- RTL coding in Verilog
- Combinational vs sequential logic modeling
- Finite State Machine design
- Testbench-driven verification
- Clean reset and clock handling
